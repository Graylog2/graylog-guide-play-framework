This modules provides a logback appender that writes to Graylog2 via GELF over TCP.

To use this module, add the following dependency to your build.sbt/Build.scala file:

"org.graylog2" % "play2-graylog2" % "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

TODO: publish to maven central

In your application.conf you can set a couple of entries to configure the behavior of the appender:

graylog2.appender.hosts=["127.0.0.1:12201"]
graylog2.appender.queue-size=512
